\section{Mechanism Design}

With social choice theory, we looked at how to aggregate preferences
assuming these were observable. Gibbard-Satterthwaite points us toward the
direction of imperfectly observable preferences that must be revealed by
the individuals before they can be aggregated.

\hspace{1em}
We again consider a set of agents $n$ which will make a collective choice
form a set of alternatives $X$. Utility functions $u_i(x, \theta_i)$ are
commonly known, but are determined by a pivately known random variable
$\theta_i \in \Theta_i$ which is the agent's type. Typically there is a
commonly known prior $\phi(\cdot)$ representing a density over $\theta \in
\Theta_1 \times \ldots \times \Theta_n$. Since the utility functions
themselves are common knowledge in this context, all uncertainty handled is
through the type. Types can also encode the beliefs of an agent. Our new
formulation of a social choice function is a straightforward extension
based on this.

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{social choice function} is a rule $f:
  \Theta_1 \times \ldots \times \Theta_n \to X$ that
  assigns a chosen element $f(\theta) \in X$ for each
  profile of individual preferences derived from the
  vector of types $\theta$.
\end{definition}

Some properties are also simple extensions:

\begin{definition}
  The social choice function $f: \Theta \to X$ is
  \textbf{ex-post efficient} if for all $\theta \in
  \Theta$ there does not exist an $x \in X$ such that
  $u_i(x, \theta_i) \geq u_i(f(\theta), \theta_i)$ for
  all $i$ and $u_i(x, \theta_i) > u(f(\theta), \theta_i)$
  for some $i$.
\end{definition}

\section{Mechanisms and Implementation}

Since agents' types are private information, they must communicate this
information to the rest of the group or a central body. We could have any
theory about how agents choose the messages they will send, but we
typically assume messages will be chosen strategically. Once the messages
are collected, an outcome will be chosen by the group. Together, the
possible messages and the mapping from messages to outcomes define a
mechanism.

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{mechanism} $\xi = \{(M_1, \ldots, M_n),
  g(\cdot)\}$ is a collection of $n$ message sets (or
  strategy sets) and an outcome function $g: M_1 \times
  \ldots \times M_n \to X$.
\end{definition}

Mechanisms can be considered as procedures for how a
collective decision is actually made, including a specification of
strategy sets. We can now compare what outcomes are
realized in equilibrium through a mechanism with the
outcomes we ``want'' to see happen, as represented by a
social choice function. If an outcome function $g$ and
a social choice function $f$ coincide on some restriction
of their domain, then we say $g$ implements $f$. The
particular restriction depends on the equilibrium concept used.

\begin{definition}
  The mechanism $\xi = \{(M_1, \ldots, M_n),
  g(\cdot)\}$ \textbf{implements} a social choice function $f$ if
  there is an equilibrium strategy profile
  $(m_1^*(\cdot), \ldots, m_n^*(\cdot))$ of the game
  induced by $\xi$ such that $\forall \theta \in \Theta$,
  \[g(m_1^*(\theta_1), \ldots, m_n^*(\theta_n)) =
  f(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n)\]
\end{definition}

The term equilibrium here is still vague and we will extend this definition
to talk about implementation in various contexts. The mechanism itself
might have multiple equilibria. If the outcome of one equilibrium coincides
with the scf, then the scf is \textit{partially} implemented. If the
outcomes of all equilibria coincide with the scf, then the scf is
\textit{fully} implemented.  Figure \ref{reiterdiagram} depicts the generic
implementation problem.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\columnwidth]{reiterdiagram}
    \caption{Reiter diagram of a
  mechanism $\xi$ implementing $f$}
\label{reiterdiagram}
\end{figure}

Due to the revelation principle, we can usually think of
the message space as the type space, and most mechanisms
we'll look at are direct revelation mechanisms. This also
leads us to a notion of incentive compatibility.

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{direct revelation mechanism} for $f$ is a mechanism
  in which $M_i = \Theta_i$ for all $i$ and $g(\theta) =
  f(\theta)$ for all $\theta \in \Theta_1 \times \ldots
  \times \Theta_I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The social choice function $f$ is \textbf{truthfully
    implementable} if the direct revelation mechanism has
  an equilibrium $(m_1^*(\cdot), \ldots, m_n^*(\cdot))$
  in which $m_i^*(\theta_i) = \theta_i$ for all $i$ and
  $\theta$, i.e. each agent telling the truth is an
  equilibrium of the induced game. Alternatively, such a
  mechanism is \textbf{incentive compatible}.
\end{definition}

\section{Dominant Strategy Implementation}
\label{sec:domin-strat-impl}

\begin{definition}
  A mechanism $\xi = \{(M_1, \ldots, M_n),
  g(\cdot)\}$ is a \textbf{dominant-strategy
    implementation} of a social choice function $f$ if
  there is a dominant strategy equilibrium profile
  $(m_1^*(\cdot), \ldots, m_I^*(\cdot))$ of the game
  induced by $\xi$ such that $\forall \theta \in \Theta$,
  $g(m_1^*(\theta_1), \ldots, m_I^*(\theta_I)) =
  f(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_I)$.
\end{definition}

Here we start with some scf $f$ and ask whether a mechanism exists such
that the outcome from agents playing a dominant strategy matches the scf
for all realization of types. If this was the case, then we would have a
very robust way of implementing the scf, since we can be confident about
what agents will want to do, regardless of what other agents do or what their types are.

\hspace{1em}
Incentive compatibility in this context is also a simple
extension.
\begin{definition}\label{IC}
  The scf $f(\cdot)$ is \textbf{truthfully implementable in dominant
  strategies} or \textbf{strategy-proof} if for all $i$ and $\theta_i$, \[u_i(f(\theta),\theta_i, \theta_{-i})
  \geq u_i(f(\hat{\theta}_i, \theta_{-i}),
  \hat{\theta}_i, \theta_{-i})\] for all $\hat{\theta}_i$
  and $\theta_{-i}$.
\end{definition}

Now we have the powerful, if nearly trivial,
revelation principle for dominant strategy implementation:
\begin{theorem}
  Suppose there exists a mechanism $\xi$ that implements
  $f$ in dominant strategies. Then $f$ is truthfully
  implementable in dominant strategies.
\end{theorem}

Checking whether an arbitrary scf can be implemented in dominant strategies
seems like a monumental task; imagine trying to search over all possible
procedures for making a choice. By this theorem though, we know if there is
such a mechanism, there is also a direct revelation mechanism where
agents report their types honestly. Hence, checking implementability
reduces to checking the inequalities in Definition \ref{IC}. This
holds for many other equilibrium concepts, which justifies looking only at
revelation mechanisms. Of course, this assumes it's practical for agents to
fully communicate their types, which could potentially include a full set
of beliefs, beliefs about beliefs, etc, without cost, so we might be
trading one intractability for another.

\section{Nash Implementation}
\label{sec:nash-implementation}

Maskin focuses on general preferences and social choice correspondences,
which leads to the following definition:

\begin{definition}
  A mechanism $\{(S_i, \ldots, S_I), g(\cdot)\}$ with
  $g:\prod S_i \to X$ implements the social choice
  rule $f: \prod R_i \twoheadrightarrow X$ in Nash
  equilibrium if
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\forall x \in f(\succeq), \, \exists (s_1, \ldots,
    s_I)$ such that $x = g(s_1, \ldots, s_I)$ and $x \succeq_i g(s'_i, s_{-i})$ for all $i$ and all $s'_i$.
  \item If $(s_1, \ldots, s_I)$ is a Nash equilibrium,
    then $g(s) \in f(\succeq)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The first part extends our implementation to
correspondences, while the second requires that all Nash
equilibria result in outcomes in the social choice
rule. Then, Maskin gives us the following result:

\begin{theorem}
  If $f: R^n \twoheadrightarrow X$ is implementable in
  Nash equilibrium, then $f$ is monotonic.
\end{theorem}

This provides an easy first check to see whether a scr is
Nash-implementable. However, the converse is not
true. We'll need another condition:

\begin{definition}
  A scr $f: R^n \twoheadrightarrow X$ satisfies
  \textbf{no veto power (NVP)} if for all preference
  profiles $\succeq$ and all $x\in X$, then for all agents
  $i$ we have \[\forall j \neq i, \forall y\in X, \, x \succeq_j
  y \implies x\in f(\succeq)\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  With at least three players, if $f$ is monotonic and
  satisfies NVP, then $f$ is Nash-implementable.
\end{theorem}

\section{Exercises}
\label{sec:exercises}

\begin{exercise}[p. 57 of \textit{Toolbox for Economic Design}]
  Assume a social choice function $f: \Theta \to X$ is
  dominant-strategy incentive compatible. Let $\bar{f}: \bar{\Theta} \to
  X$, where $\bar{\Theta} \subset \Theta$, be the restriction of $f$ to
  $\bar{\Theta}$, i.e. $\theta \in \bar{\Theta} \implies \bar{f}(\theta) =
  f(\theta)$. Is $\bar{f}$ also dominant-strategy incentive compatible?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[p. 56 of \textit{Toolbox for Economic Design}]
  Imagine a society that consists of a single couple, Link and Zelda. The
  couple is trying to decide whether to paint their castle black, white, or
  silver. Zelda has one type $\theta_Z$. Her ranking is
  white~$\succ$~silver~$\succ$~black. Link, on the other hand, has two
  possible types: $\theta_L$ and $\bar{\theta}_L$. When his type is
  $\theta_L$, his ranking is black~$\succ$~silver~$\succ$~white. When he is
  type $\bar{\theta}_L$, his ranking is
  silver~$\succ$~white~$\succ$~black.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose we wish to implement the following social choice function:
    $f(\theta_Z, \theta_L) =$ silver and $f(\theta_Z, \bar{\theta}_L) =$
    white. Will Link choose to truthfully reveal his type?
  \item What if the desired social choice function is
    $f(\theta_Z, \theta_L) =$ black and $f(\theta_Z,
    \bar{\theta}_L) =$ white?
  \item What about  $f(\theta_Z, \theta_L) =$ silver and $f(\theta_Z,
  \bar{\theta}_L) =$ silver?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Dutta and Sen (2012), ``Nash implementation with partially honest individuals'']
  Suppose an individual has preferences over which message they send in addition to
  preferences over outcomes. In particular, suppose individuals don't like to lie
  when it doesn't help them. Let's call an agent \emph{partially honest} if
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For $a \succ_i b$, the preference over outcome/message pairs are strict: $(a, m_i') \succ_i (b, m_i''),\;\forall m_i', m_i''$
  \item For $a \sim_i b$ and $m_i^*$ is the honest message, the agent strictly
    prefers to be honest: $(a, m_i^*) \succ_i (b, m_i'), \; \forall m_i' \ne m_i^*$
  \end{enumerate}
  Show: If $n \ge 3$ and at least one agents is partially honest, then any SCR
  satisfying No Veto Power is fully Nash implementable.
\end{exercise}
